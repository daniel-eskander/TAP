Microvium JavaScript VM
=======================

This library builds the [Microvium](https://github.com/coder-mike/microvium) JavaScript VM.
Microvium is a JavaScript interpreter that uses Node.js on a large computer to compile JavaScript code to bytecode that can be executed on the device.
This library allows the code of the interpreter to be shared between different compartments, each with a private heap and VM state.
