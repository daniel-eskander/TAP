    This file documents the IL instruction set and its corresponding bytecode
    representations.

    "IL" is a dynamically-typed intermediate language, represented in either
    JSON or text format. It is the result of first stage of compilation, where
    the source text is translated to IL. IL can represent both instructions and
    data, so it used to represent the full state of a VM snapshot.

    "Bytecode" is the name given to the binary form of IL. It is actually a
    completely separate language, with a larger instruction set and different
    semantics, but there is more-or-less a straightforward relationship between
    IL instructions and their corresponding bytecode representations, so this
    document groups them together and describes the difference in semantics
    where appropriate.
  `
}, {
  title: 'Static Information',
  content: `
    Some of the opcodes described below have a "Static information" section.
    Static information is additional information that can be derived by static
    analysis in order to produce more efficient bytecode. In cases where there
    are multiple possible bytecode representations for an IL operation, the
    static information is one mechanism used by the bytecode emitter to
    choose the most suitable bytecode form.

    The original intent of static information is that a program with static
    information must behave exactly the same way if the static information is
    all removed (but not necessarily if just some if it is removed), so that the
    JS-implemented VM can directly execute IL without consulting the static
    information.

    However, there are cases that break this intended invariant. In particular,
    the semantics of function calls change based on static information in a way
    that is not compatible with the semantics of the original IL.

    A typical compilation pipeline will involve:

      1. Translate the source text to IL.
      2. (Optional) Perform static analysis and produce {IL + static information}
      3. Emit bytecode from the {IL + optional static information}

      See also [Return](#Return).

      ### Basic Behavior

      For the basic function call, the callee must push the
      function reference and each of the arguments onto
      the stack in order. The CALL operation pushes
      3-4 words to the stack to save the current registers, and then passes
      control to the given function.

      The CALL operation also sets flags in the VM state to indicate what
      dynamic elements were pushed onto the stack. When the matching RETURN
      operation is later executed, it will consult these flags to decide what to
      pop off the stack (so far, this is only the \`scope\` register).

      This basic behavior is what's shown in the
      diagram below. There are variations on this basic behavior, as discussed
      below.

      \`VM_OP2_CALL_3\` is the most general bytecode form of a call, but the
      expectation is that \`VM_OP_CALL_5\` and \`VM_OP2_CALL_6\` will be the most common
      manifestations of a call instruction in a typical script, after optimization.

      ### Host Functions

      Calls to host functions (known as "native calls") do not save the current
      registers on the Microvium stack -- they instead save them on the C stack,
      and then they call C function pointer corresponding to the function
      reference, and set the \`AF_CALLED_FROM_EXTERNAL\` flag.

      ### Reentrancy

      Microvium is reentrant -- host functions called by Microvium may in turn
      call Microvium functions. The \`AF_CALLED_FROM_EXTERNAL\` VM flag signals
      the boundary between the two. When [RETURNing](#Return) from a context with
      \`AF_CALLED_FROM_EXTERNAL\`, it will end the current Microvium run loop and return to
      the host.

      ### Short Calls

      The naive bytecode representation of a JavaScript call operation is quite
      verbose, involving a 24-bit [Lit](#VM_OP3_LOAD_LITERAL) operation to push
      the function pointer, followed by a 16-bit [Call](#VM_OP2_CALL_3)
      operation with the embedded argument count -- a total of 5 bytes.

      The short-call ([VM_OP_CALL_1](#VM_OP_CALL_1) and [VM_OP2_CALL_6](#VM_OP2_CALL_6)) bytecode operations are a
      1-2 byte call form that exists for the most frequent calls. They have a
      4- or 8-bit opcode followed by a 4- or 8-bit reference to an entry in the global
      short-call table, where each entry in the table embeds both the function
      reference and the argument count for the corresponding call operation as a
      3-byte structure. The space-savings comes primarily when there are multiple
      calls to the same function with the same number of arguments.

      Short-call table entries can reference either Microvium or host functions.
      A maximum of 256 short-call table entries are possible, with the first 16 being addressable
      with a single-byte CALL and the others addressable with a 2-byte CALL. It's up to the
      optimization pass to decide which call operations should be short-calls.

      For CALLs where the argument count and target are known, but the combination
      of target + argument count are only used up to 3 times in the application,
      a \`VM_OP_CALL_5\` call may be more efficient.

      This is the inverse of [ScopePush](#ScopePush). It removes the top scope
      from the closure scope chain and sets the \`scope\` register to instead
      point to its \`outerScope\`.

      Note: when an IL function [Return](#Return) to its caller, the caller's
      scope is recovered along with the other saved registers, so you do not
      need to \`ScopePop\` at the end of a function.

      This instruction is intended for the context of loops with nested
      closures, since each iteration of the loop requires a fresh closure scope
      for the variables in the loop body, and the previous one must be popped
      off the closure scope stack.

      Note: It is illegal to invoke this instruction when there is no closure
      scope on the scope stack.
